## 1. CSS Box Model

The CSS Box Model is the mechanism used by web browsers to construct a web page from HTML and CSS code. Understanding the Box Model is crucial to becoming proficient in CSS layout.

Key components include:

- Box Properties: These include the width and height of an element, padding and margins around the element, and borders around the element.

- Visual Display Models: These specify how elements are displayed in the browser and include block, inline, and inline-block models.

- Box Sizing Model: This includes the content-box and border-box models. The content-box model excludes padding and borders from the width and height of an element, while the border-box model includes them.

- Dimensions: This refers to the sizes of elements and can be specified in absolute units (like pixels) or relative units (like percentages).

- General Concepts: Some general terms to be familiar with include the "container" (which is an element that contains other elements), "physical pixels" (the actual pixels on a screen), and "CSS reference pixels" (a unit of measurement used in CSS).

## 2. Everything is a Box

When it comes to CSS, everything is considered a box. Here's how the browser renders HTML pages:

- Browsers display elements (referred to as "words") horizontally until they encounter an element that does not fit. In such a case, the browser starts a new line.
- The browser processes one element at a time, calculating how much horizontal and vertical space (in the form of a rectangle or box) it needs to draw them. This calculation uses both browser defaults and CSS. 
- If there's enough space remaining on the current line, the element is placed there; otherwise, a new line is started.

Key points about widths, heights, and box properties:

- `inline-block` elements are laid out side by side up to the page width. If an element does not fit, it starts a new line.
- Width and Height: Define the vertical and horizontal space needed for the content area of the box. These may or may not include padding and borders and are usually automatically determined by the browser.
- Padding: The area surrounding the content area of the box, separating the content from its border. It's typically opaque and hides anything it overlays.
- Border: The boundary surrounding the padding.
- Margin: A transparent area outside the border, providing separation between elements.
- Display: Determines how the browser lays out an element relative to its neighbors.

## 3. Box Sizing

The `box-sizing` property in CSS controls how the width and height of elements are calculated. It has two primary values:

- `content-box`: The `width` and `height` properties specify the size of the actual content area. Padding and borders are added to this to determine the size of the visible box.
- `border-box`: The `width` and `height` properties are interpreted as the total width and height of the box, excluding margins but including padding and borders.

## 4. Visual Formatting Model

The `display` property in CSS has over two dozen values, but `block`, `inline`, and `inline-block` are the most commonly used.

- Block Elements: Typically group one or more elements into areas of the page. They occupy all horizontal space available within their container with nothing to the left or right of the block. 
- Inline Elements: Provide semantic meaning to small sections of text. Unlike block elements, inline elements ignore `width` and `height` properties and use values computed from the element content.
- Inline-Block Elements: A mixture of block and inline elements. They act like block elements, but unlike block elements, inline-block elements do not take up an entire row when the width property is less than the available width.

## 5. Padding and Margins

- Padding and margins both add whitespace around elements, but padding lies inside the border while margins lie outside.
- Padding is part of the visible and clickable bounds of an element, while margin is spacing between adjacent elements.
- Top and bottom margins collapse between `block` elements.
- Use margins for spacing between elements.
- Use padding to affect the visible or clickable area of an element. 
- Within a container, use padding for horizontal separation between its edges and content, and use margins for the vertical distance.
